# BGFX_Noesis_Renderer
 A renderer for the Noesis GUI system with BGFX
 
# Note
This has been copy and pasted from a custom in-house game engine - 
so it is NOT a plug and play repository.<br>
But it should give you an idea and enough sample code<br>
to replace some engine specific parts with your own code and make it work.
